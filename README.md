Files:

# tray_vars.scad

Contains the various variables used by the others file to create the desired tray, dividers, and optionally a lid.

# token_tray_base.scad

Renders the base of the tray with holes for magnets and cut ins for dividers.

# token_tray_dividers.scad

Renders out all the dividers in one hit.

# token_tray_lid.scad

Kind of a shallow version of the base, has holes for magnets but no slots for dividers as the dividers are sized to stop at the lip of the base.
